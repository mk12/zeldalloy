# Mutoh Tiles

This is the Xs and Os puzzle in Phantom Hourglass. There are a few of them in Mutoh's Temple.

This puzzle is actually really easy because you can hit the hammer on tiles outside the puzzle as well (which allows you to flip corners individually). To make the puzzle more interesting, I modelled it assuming you can only hit the 9 tiles. The shortest solution takes 9 steps.
